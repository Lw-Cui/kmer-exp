#Kmer Graph

##Assumption
Before our processing for each `k-mer` there is a continuous, unique integer to represent it.

##Introduce
In this section of our solution to `kmer index problem`, a directed graph will be build to find the longest (simple) path.

Every node in this graph is indexed by its ID and traversal adjacency node using a `STL list`.


##Usage
Just `make` and run. Please use `pipe` to redirect input file.
